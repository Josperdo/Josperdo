# Hi, I’m John 👋

Currently operating in the **GRC** space with a strong focus on cybersecurity frameworks and risk management.  
I’m actively building **technical security skills** through hands-on projects, labs, and automation — aiming to transition into a more technical role in security engineering, application security, detection engineering, etc.
