# Hi, I’m John 👋

Currently operating in the **GRC** space with a strong focus on cybersecurity frameworks and risk management, I’m actively building **technical security skills** through hands-on projects, labs, and automation — aiming to transition into a more technical role in security engineering, application security, detection engineering, etc.

### 🔍 Current Focus
- Building security tools & automation scripts
- Configuring and hardening cloud/IAM environments
- Studying offensive security techniques in a safe lab environment to improve detection & defense
- Developing practical, reproducible projects to reinforce technical skills
